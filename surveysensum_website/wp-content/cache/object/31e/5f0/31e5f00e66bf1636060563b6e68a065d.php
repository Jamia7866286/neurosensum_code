A customer satisfaction (CSAT) survey is defined as a set of questions asked to a customer, to gauge their level of satisfaction with a product or service or organization.

For example, if a smartphone company wants to understand and measure the satisfaction of customers with the various key features of the phone then the best way to find out this is to ask customers directly. This can be done using a CSAT survey with questions like,

‚ÄúQ: Please rate your level of satisfaction with each of the following features of the phone [mobile brand name]:‚Äù (with a 1-5 rating or star-based graphical rating questions)

<strong>‚ÄúAnswer options:</strong>
- Phone screen (rating scale)
- RAM (rating scale)
- Processor (rating scale)
- Camera (rating scale)‚Äù
