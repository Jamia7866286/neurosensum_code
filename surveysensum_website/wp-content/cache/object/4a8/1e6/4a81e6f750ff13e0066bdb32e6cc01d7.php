<h2>1. What are Cookies?</h2>
Cookies are small bits of data we store on the device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or any other mobile device) that you use to access any of the SurveyMonkey websites (the Sites), so we can recognize repeat users. Each cookie expires after a certain period depending on what we use it for. Like most commercial websites we use cookies on SurveyMonkey web pages. We use cookies for several reasons. Below we list and describe the various types of cookies we use on our site.

By using Surveysensum's websites, you expressly consent to the use of cookies as described on this page as well as in our <a href="https://www.surveysensum.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>. Please see below for details on each of the types of cookies we use.

&nbsp;
<h2>2. What types of cookies do we use?</h2>
Below we list the different types of cookies that may be used on the Sites. We keep updating our policy every half year (to include detailed lists of cookies used on each of our Sites to include information about type of cookie, expiry periods and links to third party sites where applicable).

We use both 1st party cookies (which are set by the Sites being visited) and 3rd party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our Sites) as described below:
<h2>3. Technical Cookies</h2>
(Examples: BIPS or login session cookies)

Certain cookies are necessary for the Sites to operate correctly. For example, we use cookies to authenticate you. When you log on to our websites, authentication cookies are set which let us know who you are during a browsing session.
<h2>4. Functionality Cookies</h2>
(Example: language setting cookies)

These cookies are used to enable certain additional functionality on our websites, such as storing your preferences (e.g. username and language selection) and preventing users from taking the same survey multiple times. This functionality improves user experience.
<h2>5. Preference Cookies</h2>
(Example: RTP Cookies - customizing content)

Preference cookies collect information about your choices and preferences and allow us to remember language or other local settings and customize the Sites accordingly.
<h2>6. Social Media Cookies</h2>
(Example: Facebook/LinkedIN using social media for behavioral advertising, analytics, advertising and market research)Social media cookies collect information about social media usage.
<h2>7. Analytics Cookies</h2>
(Example of third-party cookie: Mouseflow/Google Analytics)

Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the Sites and enable us to improve the way it works. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the Sites, help us record any difficulties you have with the Sites, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Sites, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyse the sites' traffic.
<h2>8. Targeting or advertising cookies</h2>
(Example of third-party using targeting cookies: AdRoll/Google Analytics)

We may use cookies to market Surveysensum services to you on third party websites. For example, if you visit our website, you may then see an advertisement for Surveysensum services on certain third-party websites you visit in the future. Information about this is described under the paragraph in our Privacy Policy which is entitled "We may disclose the presence of a cookie to advertise our services."

We sometimes use cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited our websites. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after we receive it. This process helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

We also contract with third-party advertising networks that may collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, emails, and on third-party websites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting website navigational information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. You may see these advertisements on other websites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
<h2>9. How Do I Manage Cookies?</h2>
If you'd like to remove or disable cookies via your browser, you certainly can. You'll want to refer to your browser's configuration documentation to do this since the steps for doing so are usually browser specific. One important note is that if you do go this route, this might adversely impact your ability to use our services effectively. Enabling cookies ensures a smoother experience when you use our site.
