<strong>Use of survey responses (Surveysensum surveys)</strong>

In general survey responses to Surveysensum surveys are controlled and managed by the Creator (the person who sent or deployed that survey). In those instances, Surveysensum is only processing those responses on behalf of the Creator.

Creator and Respondent trust is paramount to everything we do and so when we do use data about Respondents, we put Creators and Respondents first. When we do analysis of response data we only do so once we have ensured the anonymity of individual respondents (by aggregating and anonymizing the data).

Our goal is to improve the user experience across Surveysensum survey services while maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of responses.

We go into more detail below on how Surveysensum uses survey data. A Creator has some controls over how we use responses in their Account settings and may have turned off our ability to¬†apply machine learning to¬†responses where it is feature linked.

Surveysensum uses data in the ways described below, for¬†our¬†legitimate interests as described in this section:

The data impacted by this section includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Survey type, question type and responses (at an aggregated and anonymized level only)</li>
 	<li>Device data</li>
 	<li>Log data</li>
</ul>
Surveysensum will use automated processes and machine learning, to analyze survey responses, which in turn helps us to:
<ul>
 	<li>Aggregate response data and activity:¬†We will aggregate responses, activity and behavior of Respondents so that we can identify trends, build product features that optimize responses, make product recommendations and provide guidance on which products and services work best in different scenarios. These product features also provide feedback and recommendations to increase response rates. For an example of this check out how Surveysensum Genius works.</li>
 	<li>Extract and analyze usage patterns:¬†By understanding response data and Respondent interaction in different types of surveys we can:
<ul>
 	<li>improve our services and ease of use: for example, we might identify when respondents prefer multiple choice versus open text questions and make predictive response suggestions when certain question types are selected. We might also use this data to help improve analysis of responses,</li>
 	<li>undertake personalization for survey Creators and Respondents (for example by customizing the page on our website which a Respondent sees at the end of a survey. If a Respondent does not want to be included in this personalization they can¬†<u>clear the cookies in their browser settings after taking a survey</u>,</li>
 	<li>improve user experience (for example, by collecting and using device and browser information from Respondents to improve how our survey service operates on those devices and in those browsers), and</li>
 	<li>identify insightful data trends (which never identify any individuals).</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Visitor</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>¬†</strong>We process personal data about you where:
<ul>
 	<li>You have consented or;</li>

 	<li>developing new products and service features.</li>
</ul>
</li>

When you have consented we collect and use the following information about you:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Contact Information.</strong></li>
</ul>
We use contact information to respond to your inquiries, send you information as part of the services, and send you marketing information (as long as you have agreed to this at the point of providing your information and for as long as you do not opt-out).
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cookies¬†and similar technology.</strong></li>

These third party data and advertising platforms may sometimes use data that we provide to them in order to improve their technologies and their ability to match common devices to users.

As a result of the above data we collect, we also carry out the following¬†processing for legitimate business interests pursued by us:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Profiling</strong></li>

For instance, we evaluate which ads are clicked on most often, and whether those clicks lead users to make better use of our tools, features and services. If you don‚Äôt want to receive ads that are tailored to you based on your online activity, you may ‚Äúopt out‚Äù of many of the companies that are involved in such tailoring by going to¬†<a href="https://www.aboutads.info/">https://www.aboutads.info</a>,¬†<a href="https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/</a>or, if you‚Äôre located in the European Union, at¬†<a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">https://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Opting out in this way does not mean you will not receive any ads; it just means that you will not receive ads from such companies that have been tailored to you based on your activities and inferred preferences.
