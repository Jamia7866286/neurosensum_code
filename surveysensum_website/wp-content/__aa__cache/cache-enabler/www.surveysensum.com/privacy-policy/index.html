You can read more about this in relation to surveys below.</p><ul><li><strong>To manage our services we will also internally use your information and data, for the following limited purposes:</strong><ul><li>To enforce our agreements where applicable.</li><li>To prevent potentially illegal activities.</li><li>To screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity.

If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.</p><p><strong>Use of survey responses (Surveysensum surveys)</strong></p><p>In general survey responses to Surveysensum surveys are controlled and managed by the Creator (the person who sent or deployed that survey). In those instances, Surveysensum is only processing those responses on behalf of the Creator.</p><p>Creator and Respondent trust is paramount to everything we do and so when we do use data about Respondents, we put Creators and Respondents first. When we do analysis of response data we only do so once we have ensured the anonymity of individual respondents (by aggregating and anonymizing the data).</p><p>Our goal is to improve the user experience across Surveysensum survey services while maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of responses.</p><p>We go into more detail below on how Surveysensum uses survey data. A Creator has some controls over how we use responses in their Account settings and may have turned off our ability to apply machine learning to responses where it is feature linked.</p><p>Surveysensum uses data in the ways described below, for our legitimate interests as described in this section:</p><p>The data impacted by this section includes:</p><ul><li>Survey type, question type and responses (at an aggregated and anonymized level only)</li><li>Device data</li><li>Log data</li></ul><p>Surveysensum will use automated processes and machine learning, to analyze survey responses, which in turn helps us to:</p><ul><li>Aggregate response data and activity: We will aggregate responses, activity and behavior of Respondents so that we can identify trends, build product features that optimize responses, make product recommendations and provide guidance on which products and services work best in different scenarios. These product features also provide feedback and recommendations to increase response rates. For an example of this check out how Surveysensum Genius works.</li><li>Extract and analyze usage patterns: By understanding response data and Respondent interaction in different types of surveys we can:<ul><li>improve our services and ease of use: for example, we might identify when respondents prefer multiple choice versus open text questions and make predictive response suggestions when certain question types are selected. We might also use this data to help improve analysis of responses,</li><li>undertake personalization for survey Creators and Respondents (for example by customizing the page on our website which a Respondent sees at the end of a survey. If a Respondent does not want to be included in this personalization they can <u>clear the cookies in their browser settings after taking a survey</u>,</li><li>improve user experience (for example, by collecting and using device and browser information from Respondents to improve how our survey service operates on those devices and in those browsers), and</li><li>identify insightful data trends (which never identify any individuals).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Visitor</strong></li></ul><p><strong> </strong>We process personal data about you where:</p><ul><li>You have consented or;</li><li>Surveysensum’s legitimate interests of:<ul><li>improving service experience; and</li><li>developing new products and service features.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In each of the instances where we describe how we use your data in this Privacy Policy, we have identified which of these grounds for processing we are relying upon.</p><p>When you have consented we collect and use the following information about you:</p><ul><li><strong>Contact Information.</strong></li></ul><p>We use contact information to respond to your inquiries, send you information as part of the services, and send you marketing information (as long as you have agreed to this at the point of providing your information and for as long as you do not opt-out).</p><ul><li><strong>Cookies and similar technology.</strong></li></ul><p>We or third party data and advertising platforms that we work with may use or combine multiple technologies, such as cookies, page tags, mobile identifiers and IP addresses to infer users’ common identities across different services and multiple devices such as tablets, browsers, and mobile phones. We may do so, for instance, to tailor ads to users, to enable us to determine the success of our advertising campaigns and to improve upon them. These third party data and advertising platforms may sometimes use data that we provide to them in order to improve their technologies and their ability to match common devices to users.</p><p>As a result of the above data we collect, we also carry out the following processing for legitimate business interests pursued by us:</p><ul><li><strong>Profiling</strong></li></ul><p>We combine information about you from third-party sources with information we hold about you to create a user profile, which will help us to make our sales and marketing efforts more relevant to you and to personalize and improve our marketing campaigns and website experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Machine learning.</strong></li></ul><p>We use machine learning techniques on certain data in order to optimize our marketing campaigns.</p><p>We process your personal information in the following categories of data for legitimate interests pursued by us, which are described in detail in this Privacy Policy.

Cookies</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong>We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites. We use certain cookies, as described in our <a href="https://www.surveysensum.com/cookie-policy/"><u>Cookies Policy</u></a> and here in our Privacy Policy, that you agree to when you use our sites and, in the case of some cookies, for legitimate interests of delivering and optimizing our services (where the cookie delivers essential functionality). Cookies are small bits of data we store on the device you use to access our services so we can recognize repeat users. Each cookie expires after a certain period of time, depending on what we use it for. We use cookies and similar technologies for several reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>To gather metrics about your survey taking experience.</strong></li></ul><p>For example, we will collect data about the number of clicks it took Respondents to complete a survey, whether they left and returned to a survey, whether they skipped parts of a survey and how long it took to complete the survey and other details about the survey taking. However, this information is collated and kept at an aggregated and anonymized level only.</p><ul><li><strong>To make our site easier to use.</strong></li></ul><p>Creators if you use the “Remember me” feature when you sign into your account, we store your username in a cookie to make it quicker for you to sign in whenever you return to Surveysensum.</p><ul><li><strong>For security reasons.</strong></li></ul><p>We use cookies to authenticate your identity and confirm whether you are currently logged into Surveysensum or determine if an incident impacts you.</p><ul><li><strong>To provide you with personalized content.</strong></li></ul><p>We store user preferences, your default language, device and browser information, your profile information which includes, the level of usage of service and the web-pages on our site which you visit, so we can identify you across devices and personalize the content you see.</p><ul><li><strong>To improve our services.</strong></li></ul><p>We use cookies to measure your usage of our websites and track referral data, as well as to occasionally display different versions of content to you. This information helps us to develop and improve our services (it helps us focus on the parts of the service you seem most interested in) and optimize the content we display to you (which may include marketing content).</p><ul><li><strong>To advertise to you.</strong></li></ul><p>We, or our service providers and other third parties we work with, place cookies when you visit our website and other websites or when you open emails that we send you, in order to provide you with more tailored marketing content (about our services or other services), and to evaluate whether this content is useful or effective. For instance, we evaluate which ads are clicked on most often, and whether those clicks lead users to make better use of our tools, features and services. If you don’t want to receive ads that are tailored to you based on your online activity, you may “opt out” of many of the companies that are involved in such tailoring by going to <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/">https://www.aboutads.info</a>, <a href="https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/</a>or, if you’re located in the European Union, at <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">https://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Opting out in this way does not mean you will not receive any ads; it just means that you will not receive ads from such companies that have been tailored to you based on your activities and inferred preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Google Analytics.</strong></li></ul><p>In addition to the above, we have implemented on our websites and other services certain Google Analytics features that support Display Advertising, including re-targeting. Visitors to our websites may opt out of certain types of Google Analytics tracking, customize the Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ad Preferences Manager and learn more about how Google serves ads by viewing its Customer Ads Help Center. If you do not wish to participate in Google Analytics, you may also download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</p><p>You can choose to remove or disable cookies via your browser settings.</p><h2><strong>7.

Data Retention</strong></h2><p>If you hold an account with Surveysensum we do not delete the data in your account – you are responsible for and control the time periods for which you retain this data. There are controls in your account where you can delete data at the account level (all data in your account) and at the response level. If you are a Respondent, you will need to ask the Creator how long your responses will be stored in Surveysensum services.</p><p>We also describe the expiry periods for cookies on our websites in our <a href="https://www.surveysensum.com/cookie-policy/"><u>cookies policy</u></a></p><h2><strong>9. Safety of Minors</strong></h2><p>Our services are not intended for and may not be used by minors. “Minors” are individuals under the age of 18 (or under a higher age if permitted by the laws of their residence).
