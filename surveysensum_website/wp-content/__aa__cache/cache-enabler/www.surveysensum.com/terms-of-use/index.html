center;"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Thanks for using SurveySensum’s products, services, websites, and apps which are branded as “SurveySensum” (“SurveySensum Services”).</p><p>These terms of use contain the terms under which SurveySensum, and its affiliates provide their services to you and describe how the services may be accessed and used. These terms do not apply to SurveySensum Services which are available solely through our sales channel.</p><p>You indicate your agreement to these Terms by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance of these Terms, by executing a document that references them, or by using the Services.</p><p>If you will be using the Services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.</p><p>Certain country-specific terms in <u>Section 15.3</u> may apply to you if you are located outside the United States.</p><h2>1. Fees and Payments</h2><h3>1.1. Fees for Services.</h3><p>You agree to pay to SurveySensum any fees for each service you purchase or use, in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Service. Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your account management page. If you have elected to pay the fees by credit card, you represent and warrant that the credit card information you provide is correct and you will promptly notify SurveySensum of any changes to such information. Fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or when required by law.</p><h3>1.2. Subscriptions.</h3><p>Some of our Services are billed on a subscription basis (we call these “Subscriptions”). This means that you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period is called a “billing cycle”). Billing cycles are typically monthly or annual, depending on what subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel auto-renewal through your online account management page, or by <u><a href="https://www.surveysensum.com/contact-us/">contacting our customer support team</a>. </u>While we will be sad to see you go, you may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription at any time, in which case your Subscription will continue until the end of that billing cycle before terminating. You may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription immediately after the Subscription starts if you do not want it to renew.</p><h3>1.3. Taxes.</h3><p>Our prices listed do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature such as value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”) unless otherwise indicated. You are responsible for paying Taxes associated with your purchase and keeping your billing information up to date.</p><p>If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to SurveySensum, you must provide SurveySensum with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.</p><h3>1.4. Price Changes.</h3><p>SurveySensum may change the fees charged for the services at any time, provided that, for services billed on a subscription basis, the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current billing cycle of your Subscription. SurveySensum will provide you with advance notice of any change in fees.</p><h3>1.5. Overage Fees.</h3><p>Unless otherwise stated, any overage fees incurred by you will be billed in arrears. Overage fees which remain unpaid for 30 days after being billed are considered overdue. Failure to pay overage fees when due may result in the applicable Service being limited, suspended or terminated (subject to applicable legal requirements), which may result in a loss of your data associated with that Service.</p><h2>2. Privacy</h2><h3>2.1. Privacy.</h3><p>In the course of using the services, you may submit content to SurveySensum (including your personal data and the personal data of others) or third parties may submit content to you through the services (all of the above will be referred to as your “Content”). We know that by giving us your Content, you are trusting us to treat it appropriately. SurveySensum’s <a href="https://www.surveysensum.com/privacy-policy/"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a>, together with any Service-specific privacy notices or statements (collectively, “SurveySensum privacy policies”), detail how we treat your Content and we agree to adhere to those SurveySensum privacy policies. You, in turn, agree that SurveySensum may use and share your Content in accordance with the SurveySensum privacy policies and applicable data protection laws. If you are a customer who is operating as “data controller” as defined in the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) we have added some additional terms below in Section EU2 to address your obligations under this law. You also agree that you are responsible for notifying these third parties who submit content to you through our Services about the SurveySensum privacy policies.</p><h3>2.2. Confidentiality.</h3><p>SurveySensum will treat your Content as confidential information and only use and disclose it in accordance with these Terms (including the SurveySensum privacy policies). However, your Content is not regarded as confidential information if such Content:<br /> (a) is or becomes public (other than through a breach of these Terms by SurveySensum);<br /> (b) was lawfully known to SurveySensum before receiving it from you;<br /> (c) is received by SurveySensum from a third party without the knowledge of the breach of any obligation owed to you;<br /> (d) is shared in the context of your account being migrated to an organization’s Enterprise account, if your account is registered using a work email address within that organization; or<br /> (e) was independently developed by SurveySensum without reference to your Content. SurveySensum may disclose your Content when required by law or legal process, but only after SurveySensum, if permitted by law, uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify you to give you the opportunity to challenge the requirement to disclose.</p><h3>2.3. Security</h3><p>SurveySensum will store and process your Content in a manner consistent with industry security standards. SurveySensum has implemented appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative systems, policies, and procedures designed to help ensure the security, integrity, and confidentiality of your Content and to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to or use of your content.</p><p>If SurveySensum becomes aware of any unauthorized or unlawful access to, or acquisition, alteration, use, disclosure, or destruction of, personal data related to your account (“Security Incident”), SurveySensum will take reasonable steps to notify you without undue delay, but in any event within 72 hours of becoming aware of the Security Incident. SurveySensum will also reasonably cooperate with you with respect to any investigations relating to a Security Incident with preparing any required notices and provide any other information reasonably requested by you in relation to any Security Incident, where such information is not already available to you in your account or online through updates provided by SurveySensum.</p><h2>3. Your Content</h2><h3>3.1. You Retain Ownership of Your Content.</h3><p>You retain ownership of all your intellectual property rights in your content. SurveySensum does not claim ownership over any of your Content. These terms do not grant us any licenses or rights to your content except for the limited rights needed for us to provide the Services, and as otherwise described in these Terms.</p><h3>3.2. Limited License to Your Content.</h3><p>You grant SurveySensum a worldwide, royalty free license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, create derivative works, make publicly available, and otherwise exploit your content, but only for the limited purposes of providing the services to you and as otherwise permitted by the SurveySensum privacy policies. This license for such limited purposes continues even after you stop using our Services, with respect to aggregate and de-identified data derived from your Content and any residual backup copies of your Content made in the ordinary course of SurveySensum’s business. This license also extends to any trusted third parties we work with to the extent necessary to provide the Services to you. If you provide SurveySensum with feedback about the Services, we may use your feedback without any obligation to you.</p><h3>3.3. Customer Lists.</h3><p>SurveySensum may identify you (by name and logo) as a SurveySensum Services customer on SurveySensum’s website and on other promotional materials. Any goodwill arising from the use of your name and logo will inure to your benefit.</p><h3>3.5. Intellectual property claims.</h3><p>SurveySensum respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect our users to do the same. If you believe a SurveySensum user is infringing upon your intellectual property rights, you may inform us through our customer <a href="https://www.surveysensum.com/contact-us/">support team</a>. Claims of copyright infringement should follow the process outlined in these Terms, or any equivalent process available under local law.</p><h2>4. SurveySensum Intellectual Property</h2><h3>4.1. SurveySensum intellectual property</h3><p>Neither these Terms nor your use of the Services grants you ownership in the services or the content you access through the Services (other than your Content). Except as permitted by SurveySensum’s Brand and Trademark Use Policy, these Terms do not grant you any right to use SurveySensum’s trademarks or other brand elements.</p><h2>5. User Content</h2><h3>5.1. User Content</h3><p>The services display content provided by others that are not owned by SurveySensum. Such content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. Correspondingly, you are responsible for your own content and you must ensure that you have all the rights and permissions needed to use that content in connection with the services. SurveySensum is not responsible for any actions you take with respect to your content, including sharing it publicly. Please do not use content from the services unless you have first obtained the permission of its owner or are otherwise authorized by law to do so.</p><h3>5.2. Content Review</h3><p>You acknowledge that, in order to ensure compliance with legal obligations, SurveySensum may be required to review certain content submitted to the services to determine whether it is illegal or whether it violates these Terms (such as when unlawful content is reported to us). We may also modify, prevent access to, delete, or refuse to display content that we believe violates the law or these Terms. However, SurveySensum otherwise has no obligation to monitor or review any content submitted to the Services.</p><h3>5.3. Third Party Resources.</h3><p>SurveySensum may publish links in its Services to internet websites maintained by third parties. SurveySensum does not represent that it has reviewed such third-party websites and is not responsible for them or any content appearing on them. Trademarks displayed in conjunction with the Services are the property of their respective owners.</p><h2>6. Account Management</h2><h3>6.1. Keep Your Password Secure.</h3><p>If you have been issued an account by SurveySensum in connection with your use of the services, you are responsible for safeguarding your password and any other credentials used to access that account. You, and not SurveySensum, are responsible for any activity occurring in your account (other than activity that SurveySensum is directly responsible for which is not performed in accordance with your instructions), whether or not you authorized that activity. If you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account, you should notify SurveySensum immediately. Accounts may not be shared and may only be used by one individual per account.</p><h3>6.2. Keep Your Details Accurate.</h3><p>SurveySensum occasionally sends notices to the email address registered with your account. You must keep your email address and, where applicable, your contact details and payment details associated with your account current and accurate.</p><h3>6.3. Remember to Backup.</h3><p>You are responsible for maintaining, protecting, and making backups of your Content. To the extent permitted by applicable law, SurveySensum will not be liable for any failure to store, or for loss or corruption of, your Content.</p><h3>6.4. Account Inactivity.</h3><p>SurveySensum may terminate your account and delete any Content contained in it if there is no account activity (such as a log in event or payment) for over 12 months. However, we will attempt to warn you by email before terminating your account to provide you with an opportunity to log in to your account so that it remains active.</p><h3>6.5. Customer Success.</h3><p>SurveySensum may assign you a Customer Success Manager (“CSM”). The CSM may review your use of the services to help you to more effectively use the Services, including by providing reporting and usage insight.</p><h2>7. User Requirements</h2><h3>7.1. Legal Status.</h3><p>If you are an individual, you may only use the Services if you have the power to form a contract with SurveySensum. If you do not have the power to form a contract, you may not use the Services. If you are not an individual, you warrant that you are validly formed and existing under the laws of your jurisdiction of formation, that you have full power and authority to enter into these Terms, and that you have duly authorized your agent to bind you to these Terms.</p><h3>7.2. Minors.</h3><p>“Minors” are individuals under the age of 18 (or a higher age as provided in certain countries and territories). None of the Services are intended for use by Minors. If you are a Minor in your place of residence, you may not use the Services. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not a Minor.</p><h3>7.3. Embargoes.</h3><p>You may only use the Services if you are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. If you are located in a country embargoed by United States or other applicable law from receiving the Services, or are on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List, or the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, you are not permitted to purchase any paid Services from SurveySensum. You will ensure that:<br /> (a) your end users do not use the Services in violation of any export restriction or embargo by the United States; and<br /> (b) you do not provide access to the Services to persons or entities on any of the above lists.</p><h2>8.

PCI Standards.</h3><p>If you use the Services to accept payment card transactions, you must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) to the extent they are applicable to your business (the “PCI Standards”). SurveySensum provides tools to simplify your compliance with the PCI Standards, but you must ensure that your business is compliant and the specific steps you will need to take to comply with the PCI Standards will depend on your implementation of the Services.</p><h3>9.2. Cardholder Data.</h3><p>SurveySensum is responsible for the security of Cardholder Data that is collected, transmitted, stored, or processed by us on your behalf. “Cardholder Data” is defined as a cardholder’s primary account number, and where a full unmasked card number is present, any of the cardholder name, expiration date, and/or service code. SurveySensum has developed strict security features to protect Cardholder Data, and as such this data may only be used in anticipated ways and stored in appropriate places. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM COLLECTING OR ENTERING CARDHOLDER DATA INTO ANY FORM OR DATA ENTRY FIELDS IN THE SERVICES, EXCEPT INTO THOSE FIELDS INTENDED SOLELY FOR THAT PURPOSE (i.e. where SurveySensum explicitly enables such data to be entered into such fields). Appropriate fields are clearly marked with labels such as ‘Card number’ or by having a credit card icon precede them. Similarly, excluding payment forms, you must never collect or enter any “Sensitive Authentication Data”, as defined by the PCI Standards (including CVC or CVV2) into any fields in the Services. You assume all responsibility for any Cardholder Data entered into the Services in violation of these terms.</p><h2>10. Suspension and Termination of Services</h2><h3>10.1. By You.</h3><p>You can terminate your Subscription at any time through your account management page. Such termination will result in the deactivation or disablement of your account and access to it, and the deletion of content you collected through use of the services. Terminations are confirmed immediately, and you will not be charged again for that subscription unless you purchase a new one. If you terminate a Subscription in the middle of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund unless you are terminating these Terms for any of the following reasons: (a) we have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after you have so notified us in writing; (b) a refund is required by law; or (c) we, in our sole discretion, determine a refund is appropriate. For clarity, we will not grant a refund where you have used our Services, collected responses, and/or downloaded your responses unless the termination is due to our material, uncured breach or a refund is required by law.</p><h3>10.2. By SurveySensum.</h3><p>SurveySensum may terminate your Subscription at the end of a billing cycle by providing at least 30 days’ prior written notice to you. SurveySensum may terminate your Subscription for any reason by providing at least 90 days’ written notice to you and will provide a pro rata refund for any period you did not use in that billing cycle. SurveySensum may suspend performance or terminate your Subscription for any of the following reasons: (a) you have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after SurveySensum has so notified you in writing; (b) you cease your business operations or become subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days; or (c) you fail to pay fees for 30 days past the due date. Additionally, SurveySensum may limit, suspend, or terminate the Services to you: (i) if you fail to comply with these Terms, (ii) if you use the Services in a way that causes legal liability to us or disrupts others’ use of the Services; or (iii) if we are investigating suspected misconduct by you. Also, if we limit, suspend, or terminate the Services you receive, we will endeavor to give you advance notice and an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. However, there may be time sensitive situations where SurveySensum may decide that we need to take immediate action without notice. SurveySensum will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of any limitation or suspension under this Section as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action. SurveySensum has no obligation to retain your Content upon termination of the applicable Service.</p><h3>10.3. Further Measures.</h3><p>If SurveySensum stops providing the Services to you because you repeatedly or egregiously breach these Terms, SurveySensum may take measures to prevent the further use of the Services by you, including blocking your IP address.</p><h2>11. Changes and Updates</h2><h3>11.1. Changes to Terms.</h3><p>SurveySensum may change these Terms at any time for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes in applicable law or updates to Services and to account for new Services or functionality. The most current version will always be posted on the SurveySensum website. If an amendment is a material, as determined in SurveySensum’s sole discretion, SurveySensum will notify you by email. Notice of amendments may also be posted to SurveySensum’s blog or upon your login to your account. Changes will be effective no sooner than the day they are publicly posted. For certain changes to become effective, applicable law may require SurveySensum to obtain your consent to such changes or to provide you with sufficient advance notice of them. If you do not want to agree to any changes made to the terms for a Service, you should stop using that Service, because by continuing to use the Services you indicate your agreement to be bound by the updated terms.</p><h3>11.2. Changes to Services.</h3><p>SurveySensum constantly changes and improves Services. SurveySensum may add, alter, or remove functionality from a Service at any time without prior notice. SurveySensum may also limit, suspend, or discontinue a Service at its discretion. If SurveySensum discontinues a Service, we will give you reasonable advance notice to provide you with an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. SurveySensum may remove content from the Services at any time in our sole discretion, although we will endeavor to notify you before we do that if it materially impacts you and if practicable under the circumstances.</p><h3>11.3. Downgrades.</h3><p>Downgrading your account plan may cause the loss of content, features, functionality, or capacity of your account.</p><h2>12. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h2><h3>12.1. Disclaimers.</h3><p>While it is in SurveySensum’s interest to provide you with a great experience when using the services, there are certain things we do not promise about them.

You shall ensure that relevant data subjects have been informed of, and have given their consent to, such use, processing, and transfer as required by all applicable data protection laws and have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality and legality of personal data processed by SurveySensum in the provision of the Services.</p><p>EU 2.4 SurveySensum Obligations.</p><p>Where SurveySensum is processing personal data on your behalf, it will:</p><p>(a) only do so on your documented instructions and in accordance with applicable law, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, and the parties agree that these terms and the SurveySensum privacy policies constitute such documented instructions;</p><p>(b) ensure that all SurveySensum personnel involved in the processing of personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality;</p><p>(c) where applicable to you and where it is technically feasible, make available information necessary for you to demonstrate compliance with your obligations under Article 28 of the GDPR, where such information is held by SurveySensum and is not otherwise available to you through your account and user areas or on SurveySensum websites, provided that you provide SurveySensum with at least 14 days’ written notice of such an information request;</p><p>(d) promptly notify you of all requests received directly from a data subject in respect of that data subject&#8217;s personal data submitted through the Services;</p><p>(e) upon deletion by you, not retain personal data from within your account other than in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and as may otherwise be kept in routine backup copies made for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes (which are also deleted no later than 9-12 months after data is deleted from an account); and</p><p>(f) to the extent reasonably able, assist you as reasonably required (at your expense) where you wish to conduct a data protection impact assessment involving the Services.</p><p>EU 2.5 SurveySensum sub-processors.</p><p>SurveySensum uses trusted partners in facilitating certain elements of our Services (“sub-processors”).

If you wish to receive a list of sub-processors who handle personal data for SurveySensum please complete our form here. On completion of this form and entry of your details through our system, you will receive updates when we add any new sub-processors to this list and you will have 15 days to object to any additions to the list before the change is implemented by us. If you object to a particular sub-processor, who we cannot disassociate from your Services, your sole remedy will be to terminate your subscription relating to the Services that cannot be reasonably provided without the objected-to new sub-processor. Such termination will be without a right of refund for any fees prepaid by you for the period following termination.</p><p>EU 2.6 Liability.</p><p>SurveySensum will be liable for the acts and omissions of its sub-processors to the same extent SurveySensum would be liable if performing the services of each of those sub-processors directly under these Terms, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms and SurveySensum ensures that all sub-processors on the sub-processor list are bound by contractual terms that are in all material respects no less onerous than those contained in these Terms.</p><p>EU 2.7 Security Measures.</p><p>SurveySensum has, taking into account the state of the art, cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the Services and the level of risk, implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss of and/or damage to your personal data and as specified in our Security Statement which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. At reasonable intervals, SurveySensum tests and evaluates the effectiveness of these technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.</p><p>EU 2.8 Audits.</p><p>You will allow one month for SurveySensum to respond to any audit request which you make. No person/party conducting an audit on your behalf, shall be, or shall act on behalf of, a competitor of SurveySensum (“Auditor”). You will only be entitled to conduct an audit once per year (during the course of a 12 month subscription) unless otherwise legally compelled or required by a regulator with established authority over you to perform or facilitate the performance of more than 1 audit in that same year (in which circumstances you and SurveySensum will, in advance of any such audits, agree upon a reasonable reimbursement rate for SurveySensum’s audit expenses). The scope of an audit will be as follows (unless you are compelled by a regulator with authority over the processing activities involving the Services to vary this format for audit):</p><p>(a) SurveySensum agrees, subject to any appropriate and reasonable confidentiality restrictions, to provide evidence of any certifications and compliance standards it maintains and will, on request, make available to you an executive summary of SurveySensum’s (or SurveySensum affiliate’s) most recent penetration tests, which summary shall include remedial actions taken by SurveySensum resulting from such penetration tests.</p><p>(b) The scope of the certifications and penetration tests provided will be limited to SurveySensum systems, processes, and documentation relevant to the processing and protection of personal data undertaken for the Services obtained by you, and Auditor will conduct audits subject to any appropriate and reasonable confidentiality restrictions requested by SurveySensum.</p><p>(c) You will promptly notify and provide SurveySensum with full details regarding any perceived non-compliance or security concerns discovered during the course of an audit.</p><p>The parties agree that, except as otherwise required by order or another binding decree of a regulator with authority over you, this section sets out the entire scope of your audit rights as against SurveySensum.</p><p>EU 2.9 International Transfer.</p><p>To the extent applicable, SurveySensum Europe UC relies (in order of precedence) upon (i) SurveySensum Inc.’s Privacy Shield certification; (ii) standard contractual clauses, for data transfer to the United States to SurveySensum Inc.

To the extent applicable, you appoint SurveySensum as your agent for purposes of entering into any standard contractual clauses for such purposes on your behalf under these Terms. If you hold a qualifying account and are availing of the SurveySensum Data Processing Agreement with standard contractual clauses, the terms set out in that Data Processing Agreement with standard contractual clauses are supplementary to these Terms and, where there is a conflict between the terms of that Data Processing Agreement with standard contractual clauses and these Terms, the terms of the Data Processing Agreement with standard contractual clauses will prevail.</p><p>EU 2.10 Liability for Data Processing.</p><p>The parties’ respective aggregate liability whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise for any and all claims arising out of or in connection with this Section EU2 shall be as set out in these terms, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p><p><strong>France</strong></p><p>FR1.

Warranties.</p><p>If you are a consumer, statutory warranties and the warranty of merchantability apply to you despite anything to the contrary in these Terms. Any disclaimer of warranties in these Terms does not derogate from any of your statutory warranty rights listed below:</p><p>Article R. 211-4 of the French Consumer Code: “In contracts entered into between professionals, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, non-professionals or consumers, the professionals cannot contractually warrant the item to be delivered or the service to be rendered without clearly stating that, whatever the circumstances, the legal warranty binding the professional seller to cover the purchaser against any consequences of faults or hidden defects in the item being sold or the service being rendered, applies.”</p><p>Article L. 211-4 of the French Consumer Code: “The seller is required to deliver a product which is confirmed to the contract and is held liable for any lack of conformity which exists upon delivery. He is also held liable for any lack of conformity caused by the packaging or the assembly instructions, or the installation if he assumed responsibility therefor or had it carried out under his responsibility.”</p><p>Article L. 211-5 of the French Consumer Code: “To be in conformity with the contract, the product must: (1) be suitable for the purpose usually associated with such a product and, if applicable: correspond to the description given by the seller and have the features that the seller presented to the buyer in the form of a sample or model; [and] have the features that a buyer might reasonably expect it to have considering the public statements made by the seller, the producer or his representative, including advertising and labeling; or (2) have the features defined by mutual agreement between the parties or be suitable for any special requirement of the buyer which was made known to the seller and which the latter agreed to.”</p><p>Article L. 211-12 of the French Consumer Code: “Action resulting from lack of conformity lapses two years after delivery of the product.”</p><p>Article 1641 of the French Civil Code: “A seller is bound to a warranty on account of the latent defects of the product sold which render it unfit for the use for which it was intended, or which so impair that use that the buyer would not have acquired it, or would only have given a lesser price for it, had he known of them.”</p><p>Article 1648 §1 of the French Civil Code: “The action resulting from redhibitory vices must be brought by the buyer within a period of two years following the discovery of the vice”.</p><p>FR5. Limitation.</p><p>Section 11.3 (Limitation of Liability) does not apply to you if you are a consumer.</p><p><strong>Germany</strong></p><p>DE1. Right of Withdrawal.</p><p>If you are a consumer, you may withdraw your contractual declaration within 14 days without giving reasons in text form (e.g. by mail, fax, email). The time period commences upon your receipt of this information notice in textual form, but not before the conclusion of the contract and also not before we have met our information requirements as set forth under Article 246 § 2 in conjunction with § 1 paragraph 1 and 2 of the Introductory Act to the German Civil Code and our information requirements under § 312 g paragraph 1, first sentence German Civil Code in conjunction with Article 246 § 3 of the Introductory Act to the German Civil Code. Punctual dispatch of the declaration of withdrawal suffices to observe the withdrawal period. The declaration of withdrawal has to be directed to our customer support team by email to <u><a href="mailto:support@surveysensum.com">support@SurveySensum.com</a></u> or through our <u>Help Center</u>.</p><p>DE2. Consequences of Withdrawal.</p><p>In the case of a valid withdrawal, the mutually received deliverables will be returned and any benefits obtained, if any (e.g. interest), will be handed over. To the extent that you are unable to return or, where applicable, to deliver up the received deliverable and benefits obtained (e.g. use and enjoyment) in whole or in part, or only in a deteriorated condition, you may have to compensate us accordingly for loss of value, if any. This may possibly lead to the result that you will nevertheless have to fulfill the contractually owed payment obligations for the time period until withdrawal. Any obligation to reimburse payments must be fulfilled within 30 days. The period for the payment of costs will begin, in your case, with the dispatch of your declaration of withdrawal and in our case, upon receipt of same.</p><p>DE3. Special Notifications.</p><p>Your right of withdrawal expires prematurely if the contractual relationship was fully discharged by both sides at your explicit request before you have exercised your right of withdrawal.</p><p>DE4. Termination for Breach.</p><p>A failure to comply with these Terms must be material, repeated, or persistent before SurveySensum may exercise its right of termination under Section 9.2 (By SurveySensum).</p><p>DE5.

Liability Provisions.</p><p>Sections 11.2 (Exclusion of Certain Liability) and 11.3 (Limitation of Liability) do not apply and are replaced with the following: “SurveySensum’s liability to you for damages caused by slight negligence will, irrespective of its legal ground, be limited as follows: (a) SurveySensum will be liable up to the amount of foreseeable damages typical for this type of contract for a breach of material contractual obligations; and (b) SurveySensum will not be liable for a breach of any non-material contractual obligations nor for the slightly negligent breach of any other applicable duty of care. The above limitations of liability, as well as any other limitations of liability contained in these Terms, will not apply to any mandatory statutory liability, in particular to liability under the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz), and liability for culpably caused personal injuries. Additionally, such limitations of liability will not apply if and to the extent that SurveySensum has assumed a specific guarantee. The above will apply accordingly to SurveySensum’s liability to you for futile expenses. You are obliged to take adequate measures to avert and reduce damages.”</p><p><strong>Japan</strong></p><p>JP1. Privacy Disclosures.</p><p>You agree that you are responsible for notifying the respondents of any surveys that you create through the Services about how SurveySensum may use the respondents’ survey responses and personal data as described in the <a href="https://www.surveysensum.com/privacy-policy/"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a> and obtaining a prior consent for disclosing personal data to SurveySensum from the respondents of your surveys.</p><p>JP2.
