1<sup>st</sup> October is a CX Day, founded by <a href="http://www.cxpa.org/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Customer Experience Professionals Organization (CXPA)</a>. It‚Äôs the best time to check how your organization is taking initiatives to celebrate the spirit of the customer experience program.

CX is a new brand. Why? How? Many researches in the field of CX have revealed that consumers are willing to spend more for a good experience irrespective of brand.

It‚Äôs the experience that matters to win, retain and maximize the customer lifetime value (CLV). Just like in our daily life, we hardly visit the same restaurant the second time after having one bad experience customer experience. And we don‚Äôt usually visit the same e-Commerce site after witnessing the delayed delivery and failed transactions.

The world is more competitive than ever. In such a scenario, CX is the differentiator that can make your brand stand out. Once you start focusing on CX in your entire organization, you will know the reason why customers churn and don‚Äôt remain loyal to your brand. A new study by PwC, titled ‚Äú<a href="https://www.pwc.com/future-of-cx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Experience Is Everything</a>,‚Äù says a lot that there is also a quantifiable value in good customer experiences. Yes, we are talking about ROI here!
